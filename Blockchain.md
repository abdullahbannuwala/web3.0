What is the Blockchain? 
How does it work? 
But mostly, why are blockchain developers paid $140k/year on average?
A mega-thread on web3.0 and how the Blockchain might shape the future ↓

## The Beginning

In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto Published:
"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"

Explaining: 
- The reversibility and trustability issues.
- Bitcoin, a p2p version of electronic cash (not blockchain).
- The mechanics of Consensus.


## What was the blockchain?
The blockchain was only a special type of shared, and secured database, not owned by any entity, used to run the Bitcoin.
A cryptographed and autoregulated collection of transaction data, validated and stored on a network of computers.

## The Blockchain Today:
The blockchain today is a much larger concept, that ranges from Distributed Cloud Computing to, of course, Cryptovalues and NFTs.
In this thread, I'll give you a 360° overview of what is the Blockchain.

## Why Is the Blockchain Important?
Humans have this huge problem called: trustability.
Everything in our society orbits around ways to ensure trust between two or more parts.
Simply put: Blockchain solves the problem of trustability, decentralizing it.

## How do we ensure trustability?

We use the most disparate methods:
1. Contracts.
2. Reviews.
3. Stars.
4. Scores.
All of those trustability proofs are then signed by centralized entities such as governments, companies, or organizations, to ensure validity.
