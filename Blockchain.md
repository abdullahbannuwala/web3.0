## The Beginning

In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto Published:
"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"

## What was the blockchain?
The blockchain was only a special type of shared, and secured database, not owned by any entity, used to run the Bitcoin.
A cryptographed and autoregulated collection of transaction data, validated and stored on a network of computers.

## The Blockchain Today:
The blockchain today is a much larger concept, that ranges from Distributed Cloud Computing to, of course, Cryptovalues and NFTs.
